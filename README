Write a program to read the data from a hotel reservation
(room number, check-in date and check-out date) and display
the reservation data, including its duration in days. Then
read new check-in and check-out dates, update the reservation,
and display the reservation again with the updated data.

The program must not accept invalid data for the reservation,
according to the following rules:

- Reservation changes can only occur for future dates
- The check-out date must be greater than the check-in date

Examples
Room number: 8021
Check-in date (dd/MM/yyyy): 23/09/2019
Check-out date (dd/MM/yyyy): 26/09/2019
Reservation: Room 8021, check-in: 23/09/2019, check-out: 26/09/2019, 3 nights

Enter data to update the reservation:
Check-in date (dd/MM/yyyy): 24/09/2019
Check-out date (dd/MM/yyyy): 29/09/2019
Reservation: Room 8021, check-in: 24/09/2019, check-out: 29/09/2019, 5 nights
